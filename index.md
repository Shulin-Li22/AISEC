title: "Welcome to AISEC!"
---

This is Shulin Li's Blog.

This blog is aimed at documenting my personal thoughts/understanding when I read research papers related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artifical Intelligence Security. 

I named this blog **"AISEC"**, which is the abbreviation of **"AI"** and  **"Security"**.

I am currently an undergraduate student in [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn) and [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk), which is the joint programme between BUPT and QMUL.

I will continue my study at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, major in LLM Security.

As a bilingual, my native language is Chinese, and English is my second language. Therefore, my blog will feature content in either Chinese or English (I will try my best to update a English version), depending on the context.

If there is no special situation, I will try to update my blog once a week.

My blog content will update very soon!
